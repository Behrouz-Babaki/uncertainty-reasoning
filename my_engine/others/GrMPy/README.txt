GrMPy: Graphical models in Python
http://dip.sun.ac.za/vision/trac-git/agouws-GrMPy.bzr

WARNING: The current release version 0.8 contains a serious bug! The
maximum-liklihood estimation of MRF and BNET parameters does not
function correctly. It is recommended to use the code from the
repository instead. A new release of the corrected code, with new
features and installation instructions, will be released as a package
by mid June 2010.
