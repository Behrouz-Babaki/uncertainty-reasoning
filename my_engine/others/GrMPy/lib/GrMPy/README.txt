For new users, a good place to start is the examples folder. 
It contains tutorial .py files illustrating the use of many of the 
possible functions of GrMPy. Follow the folder to the tutorial you
are looking for. For example ./Examples/Discrete/MRF/Inference/Exact 
contains examples of performing exact inference on discrete Markov 
random fields.
